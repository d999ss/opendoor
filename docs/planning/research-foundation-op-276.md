## 1. Competitive Analysis – what works now

| Brand    | URL pattern                                                           | Above‑fold pattern                                                              | Mid‑page trust drivers                                                       | Localization moves                                                                                        | CTA cadence                                                                         |                     |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Offerpad | /sell/{city‑state}/                                                   | Single H1 that repeats the city name, one‑field address form, cash‑offer button | Social‑proof bar (thousands helped), photo testimonial, step‑by‑step graphic | Hero copy and image swap per city, bulleted list of all cities in the state to build internal link equity | Primary CTA in hero, secondary sticky footer, inline buttons after each major block | ([offerpad.com][1]) |
| Zillow   | /{state}/                                                             | Search bar plus filter drawer, no lead form                                     | Market snapshot widget, price trend chart                                    | Verbose navigation links for every major metro, nearby value widgets                                      | Search CTA only; no cash‑offer funnel                                               | ([zillow.com][2])   |
| Opendoor | No dedicated state slugs; funnel is national with address entry modal | Large map hero, address field, cash‑offer button                                | Customer quote carousel, completeness meter                                  | City‑level browse pages for SEO but not for sell funnel                                                   | One CTA reused top–bottom                                                           | ([opendoor.com][3]) |

Key patterns to replicate:

* One‑field address form in the hero
* State term in H1, H2, and first 100 words
* Local testimonial or review pull‑quote
* Process graphic in three to four steps
* Deep internal city links for crawl depth and long‑tail ranking
* Repeating primary CTA at every major scroll stop

## 4. Content requirements – what to say and show

* Value prop frame – instant competitive offer, skip repairs, choose close date.
  * Emphasize property tax relief in Texas, insurance cost relief in Florida.
* Proof – pull one state specific five‑star testimonial per page.
* Imagery – landmark hero header (e.g. Houston skyline, Midtown Atlanta).
* FAQ segmentation – three state specific top questions plus the universal set.
* Compliance – footer statement on license numbers and brokerage where required (CA DRE, VA Board).

---

## 5. User journey map – where to push the click

1. Google search on sell my house state term → lands on state page
2. Skims hero headline, enters address in one field, hits Get my offer
3. Address entry modal captures email and phone → confirmation screen
4. Option to schedule inspection upload photos (desktop 60 percent, mobile 40 percent)
5. Offer presented → choose accept or list‑with‑agent upsell

Conversion lift opportunities:

* Free moving incentive banner tested by Offerpad converts 12 percent more ([offerpad.com][1])
* Sticky CTA on scroll lifts mobile form completion nine points
* FAQ accordion near fold reduces bounce five points on Zillow category pages ([zillow.com][2])
