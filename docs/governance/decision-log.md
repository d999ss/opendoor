## Strategic Decisions

### DEC-003: Geo-targeting Market Prioritization

- **Date**: 2025-06-25
- **Decision Maker(s)**: Marketing and Product Leadership
- **Context**: Need to determine which geographic markets to prioritize for the initial launch
- **Decision**: Focus on top 5 markets by transaction volume (Phoenix, Atlanta, Dallas, Las Vegas, Orlando)
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Prioritize by current website traffic
  - Prioritize by competitive positioning
  - Launch all markets simultaneously with less depth
- **Implications**:
  - Requires market-specific content development for 5 markets
  - Allows for testing and optimization before wider rollout
  - May create temporary inconsistency in user experience across markets
- **Status**: Active

### DEC-004: Phased Implementation Approach

- **Date**: 2025-06-30
- **Decision Maker(s)**: Executive Steering Committee
- **Context**: Need to determine implementation strategy that balances speed, quality, and risk
- **Decision**: Adopt a phased implementation approach with quarterly releases
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Big bang launch of all components
  - Feature-by-feature gradual rollout
  - A/B testing approach with parallel systems
- **Implications**:
  - Extends timeline for full implementation
  - Reduces risk through incremental validation
  - Allows for user feedback incorporation between phases
  - Requires careful planning of dependencies between phases
- **Status**: Active

## Process Decisions

  - Outsourced content creation
- **Implications**:
  - Requires development of robust templates and guidelines
  - Balances consistency with local relevance
