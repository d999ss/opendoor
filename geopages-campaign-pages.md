# [OP-276] Opendoor Geopages + Campaign Pages

Delivery Lead: Jocelyn McArthur  
Client Partner: Nicole Hampton  
Creative Lead: Chris Kerr  
Status: Planning  
Dates: September 5, 2025  
Project Number: OP-276  

## Background and Motivation
Opendoor needs to develop and organize location-specific (geo) pages and campaign landing pages to improve SEO performance and provide targeted content for marketing campaigns. These pages will help capture location-specific search traffic and provide customized experiences for users coming from different marketing campaigns.

A detailed analysis has identified that Opendoor currently lacks robust geo-targeted content for its top markets, impacting SEO performance and local discoverability. There's an opportunity to develop a scalable strategy that balances unique market storytelling with programmatic efficiencies — ultimately increasing visibility and engagement in high-priority markets. For complete details, see the [Geo-Targeted Approach](./geo-targeted-approach.md) document.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Need to create a scalable template system for location-based content
- Must ensure consistent branding while allowing for location-specific customization
- Campaign pages need to be easily created and modified for different marketing initiatives
- Both page types need strong SEO optimization
- Content must align with the overall goal of improving brand perception and increasing offer flow
- Opendoor is not currently ranking for key non-branded search terms in major markets
- Competitors like Zillow and Offerpad have established presence in top markets

   - Success criteria: Complete analysis of target locations and SEO keywords
   - Identify high-priority markets for initial implementation
   - Research location-specific real estate trends and terminology
