# Opendoor Landing Pages Project (OP-262)

## Background and Motivation

The Opendoor Landing Pages project (OP-262) aims to transform web pages outside the offer-flow process into opportunities for providing relevant, interesting, and dynamic content to improve consumer perceptions of the Opendoor brand and increase offer flow conversions. This project is being executed by MAKEBTTR.COM for Opendoor, with a focus on redesigning three key areas: News & Press, Agent Access, and the Homepage.

According to the site brief, the hypothesis is that if Opendoor rethinks all web pages that aren't directly part of the offer-flow process as an opportunity to give consumers relevant, interesting, dynamic content, their perceptions of the Opendoor brand will improve and they'll be more likely to begin the offer flow.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Current website content, design, and development has been housed under Product Design
- The Opendoor homepage has been meticulously tested but rarely tests iterations of content beyond strict A/B tests
- The majority of paid marketing directs consumers to the homepage to begin the offer flow
- Current design is sleek and minimalist but can feel cold and humanless
- Need to add more humanity and warmth to the brand while maintaining design guidelines
- Technical SEO audit has identified numerous issues, warnings, and opportunities that need to be addressed
