# Opendoor Site Brief

**March 2025**

## Background

To date, all website content, design and dev has been housed under Product Design. The Opendoor homepage has been meticulously tested into. Rarely do we test iterations of content, and if we do, it's a strict A/B test.

The majority of paid marketing directs consumers to this page, prompting consumers to begin the offer flow.

## Hypothesis

If we rethink all web pages that aren't directly part of the offer-flow process as an opportunity to give consumers relevant, interesting, dynamic content, their perceptions of Opendoor brand will improve and they'll be more likely to begin the offer flow.

## Surface Areas

### P0 - Let's do these pages to warm us up:

1. **Press and News â†’ "Opendoor Newsroom"**
   - Combine these pages. Keep Opendoor news at top, organized by content types. Similar to [Apple's Newsroom](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/).
   - Make Opendoor created content distinct from Opendoor in the news content.
   - Include social media follow buttons at bottom
   - Consider adding Opendoor produced employee and customer stories to further enhance content
   - Put Press Kit at bottom, make more discreet
   - Kill Design Media link out
   - Update individual news story page templates for better visual optimization

2. **Improve and Consolidate Opendoor.com/Agent-Access**
   - This is the site for our Real Estate Agent Partners who come to learn about us, and also get offers on homes for their clients.
   - Bring in OD for Agents logo
   - Make this page special / different colors (Navy) to be distinct from consumer
   - Bring in more value adds:
     - Build the offer comparison calculator tool
     - "Sign up" and receive swag and the Opendoor marketing toolkit
   - Consider location-based variations (e.g., "Sell your client's homes in [MARKET]")

### P1 - once the above is complete, we'll get into the main event:

1. **Home Page**
   - This is Opendoor's literal front door. Welcome people, educate them on what we do in a flash and encourage them to try us.
   - Make it dynamic with many versions that vary by time of year and audience.
   - Personalize the experience every time we learn more about the user.
   - Build in SEO/triggers so that the sales team is notified if leads are showing interest again.
   - **Dynamic Home Page patterns:**
     - Q4 and Q1: highlight Sell Direct with the goal of people entering their address for offers. Address entry bar and clear CTA
     - Q2 and Q3: highlight optionality of Sell Direct or List with Opendoor, favoring List with. Softer language.
     - Personalization for returning visitors (e.g., "Welcome back!" and showing the picture of their house)

## Creative Guidance

### Design

- While sleek and minimalist, some of the site with its sans serif font, white background, lack of color and clean product makes our brand feel cold, humanless.
- Our design guidelines are still intact, but let's explore being additive to give the brand **more humanity, warmth**
- Explore introducing additional font to Graphik family for impactful moments on site (and marketing to follow).
- Leverage Midjourney (or other tool) for asset creation.
- Show off a product in new ways:
  - Technology is in our DNA
  - We're a modern moving solution that helps people move and sell homes instantly from a phone
  - Let's not be afraid to show off our product and UI
  - Use animation
  - Explore UI that's not in a static phone device (i.e., UI graphics come off the page/over other visuals)
